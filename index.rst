The Repoze Project
==================

The Repoze project is a collection of technologies which bridges the
`WSGI <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/>`_ and
`Zope <http://www.zope.org>`_ worlds.  The project's goals:

- Make it possible for non-Zope Python developers to selectively
  use Zope features in a WSGI environment.

- Help Zope developers integrate their applications into a WSGI
  environment.
